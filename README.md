CSV data is generated by mapping the AvailableAtSlot array to a new array nameAtSlot that maps the IDs to the actual names, then maps the TimeOfSlot array to a new array timedNames where each entry is a tuple of the formatted time string and the corresponding availability data for that time.

A string is built in CSV format, with the row headers being "Time" followed by the names of all people. For each row the formatted time string is added and the corresponding availability data, represented as 1s and 0s (1 for available, 0 for unavailable). This is encoded as a URI and opened in a new window, which should automatically download the CSV file. 
The CSV is timestamped and exported. 

Some issues can occur if you have a popup blocker active, just disable it temporarily and it should work fine.
